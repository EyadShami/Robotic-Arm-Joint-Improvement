# Robotic-Arm Joint

## Overview

This project delivers a redesigned bracket that eliminates fatigue cracks seen in field units. We achieved this by thickening key sections, adding generous fillets, and switching from 6061‑T6 to 7075‑T6 aluminium—all without touching any mating interfaces.

## 1 Dimensions To Keep
| Feature | Fixed Value |
|---------|-------------|
| Base outside | 45 mm |
| Ear-to-ear outer width | 54 mm |
| Ear height (from base top) | 29 mm |
| Base screw pattern | 4 holes, pattern |

## 2 Changes
| Area | Old | New | Benefit |
|------|-----|-----|---------|
| **Outside corner fillet** | R 15 mm | R 10 mm | 1 risk of breaking. |
| **Inside corner fillet** | R 5 mm | R 10 mm | Removes sharp stress riser. |
| **Base width sides** | 25 mm | 35 mm | increased base strength. |
| **Base width at ear roots** | 45 mm (round only) | 45 mm + small flats | Wider stance for load transfer. |
| **Material** | 6061-T6 Al | 7075-T6 Al | ~2 × yield strength with little weight gain. |
